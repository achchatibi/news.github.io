                   <p>The Milwaukee Bucks demolished the Miami Heat 144-97 on Tuesday night with the long ball, hitting 29 3-pointers to set an NBA team record for most shots made from beyond the arc.</p>
                   <br><p>The Bucks went on to add another 3-pointer, and 12 Milwaukee players contributed to the onslaught from distance as Milwaukee finished with a 47-point lead. All the Bucks played, and Giannis Antetokounmpo was the only player who didn’t make a 3-pointer. Antetokounmpo missed his two attempts from deep but finished with nine points, six rebounds and six assists in 25 minutes.</p>
                   <br><p>The Bucks’ outburst came two nights after going 7 for 38 on 3-pointers in a loss to New York</p>
                   <br><p><i>“Some nights, the basketball gods are with you a little bit,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “It’s probably one of those nights.”</i></p>

                   <p>The Bucks could not miss from beyond the arc Tuesday night.</p><br>
                   <p>Khris Middleton, who led the Bucks with 25 points and was one of seven players in double-figures for Milwaukee, nailed four of his five 3-point attempts. Jrue Holiday made six 3-pointers and finished with 24 points. Donte DiVincenzo hit five of his six attempts.</p><br>
                   <p>The Bucks were an astounding 29-of-51 (56.9%) from beyond the arc.</p>
                   <p>The Rockets set their record in an 149-113 triumph over the Suns in April 2019 as they drilled 27 shots from beyond the arc. Seven players hit at least two 3s, including Eric Gordon (8-13), James Harden (5-6) and P.J. Tucker (4-9). The Rockets shot 27-for-57 from 3, good for 47.4 %.</p><br>
                   <p>It was the biggest road win in Bucks history, topping the 39-point margin at New York on April 10, 1987. The 47-point margin matched the second-worst loss in Heat history; they lost 138-91 to Pat Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers in the eighth game of Miami’s first season.</p>
